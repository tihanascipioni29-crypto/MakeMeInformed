    <p class="note">Psychological Factors That Make People Believe Misinformation
Detecting false information is surprisingly difficult. When people encounter new information, their first instinct is usually to understand it and decide how to respond, not to evaluate whether it is accurate. Carefully checking new claims against existing knowledge requires effort, and when information seems plausible even if it is false it can be absorbed and remembered as fact. As a result, misinformation can take hold easily, especially when certain psychological factors increase susceptibility.

One important factor is source perception. People are more likely to believe misinformation when it comes from sources they see as credible or from members of their own social or ideological group. Information from an in-group feels familiar and trustworthy, while messages from perceived outsiders are often met with more skepticism. This bias means that misinformation can spread rapidly within communities that share identities, values, or beliefs.
Emotional content also plays a powerful role. False information that evokes strong emotions such as fear, anger, or outrage is more likely to be believed than neutral information. Emotionally charged messages capture attention and feel urgent, which discourages careful evaluation. People are also more inclined to believe misinformation that portrays opposing groups negatively, while being more resistant to misinformation that criticizes their own group. This emotional alignment reinforces existing attitudes and reduces critical scrutiny.
Another key factor is repetition. Repeated exposure to the same claim increases its perceived truthfulness, even when it contradicts prior knowledge. This “illusory truth effect” occurs because familiar information feels easier to process, and the brain often interprets that ease as a signal of accuracy. Over time, repeated misinformation can gradually become accepted as fact.

Susceptibility to misinformation also varies between individuals. Higher levels of education, stronger analytical reasoning skills, and better numeracy are generally associated with greater resistance to false information. In contrast, anxiety increases vulnerability, as anxious individuals are more likely to rely on emotional cues rather than careful analysis. Age differences are complex: older adults may be better at recognizing misinformation, yet they are also more likely to encounter and share false content on social media, increasing its spread.

At the center of misinformation belief is the role of emotion overriding rational evaluation. Emotional states whether positive or negative make people more likely to accept false information as true and less able to distinguish between real and fake content. Emotion activates fast, intuitive “gut-level” thinking, which is efficient but prone to error. This type of thinking consumes mental resources that would otherwise support slow, analytical reasoning. Importantly, emotion does not simply replace reasoning when reasoning is absent; it actively pushes belief upward, increasing acceptance even when people suspect the information may be false.

A related mechanism is truth bias, the human tendency to assume information is true unless there is a clear reason to doubt it. Emotional arousal weakens the triggers that normally prompt careful scrutiny, causing people to rely on intuitive impressions instead of reflective judgment. Social media platforms amplify this effect by continuously exposing users to emotionally provocative content, keeping them in an emotional mindset that makes them especially vulnerable to misleading information encountered afterward.
Contrary to common assumptions, ideological motivation plays a smaller role than expected. People do not typically use reasoning to deliberately justify politically convenient falsehoods. Instead, belief in misinformation is driven primarily by emotional and intuitive processing. Encouraging rational reflection alone does not reliably reduce belief in fake news; rather, it is emotional thinking that most strongly increases susceptibility.

Overall, emotional processing whether momentary, situational, or a stable personal tendency is the primary psychological factor that increases belief in misinformation and undermines the ability to identify what is true.</p>
